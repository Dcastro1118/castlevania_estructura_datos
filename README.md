Castlevania is the first game I ever wrote in Java. [Brandon Willis](https://github.com/ballenwillis) helped with the physics, spritesheet manipulation and splicing, and general debugging. While the code is disorganized and unoptimized, I appreciate this project because it helped me dip my feet in the waters of game development.
